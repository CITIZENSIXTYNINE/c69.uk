Hey, my name is Kris, a transgender Content Creator living in Mexico City!

I do a lot of stuff on my free time but this is kind of a summary of what I do (both as a hobby and as a job):

+ Video Editing
+ Making Music
+ Coding/Developing
+ Hunting for Lost Media
+ Designing UI/UX concepts for apps that I use
+ ~~Being a useless member of society~~
