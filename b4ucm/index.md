%Before You Contact Me - C69

Before you contact me, you should know some personal stuff about me, this is mainly just some stuff that will help you establish a proper connection with me when talking to me (like evading some topics, etc).

# General Stuff:
+ Please **do not** contact me for any kind of business inquiries on the mediums shown previously; please contact me at kris@memeware.net for that kind of stuff.
+ I identify as [genderfluid (a term under the non-binary umbrella](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Genderfluid), therefore I am transgender, so please do not ask me stuff like "What's in your pants" and other kinds of transphobic questions.
+ I'm a minor, so please do not contact me and say shit like "do you like masturbation" and other kinds of questions that you really shouldn't ask a person under 18. They're weird and I will not continue to talk to you.
+ I'm a neurodivergent person, so please have patience with me (this doesn't mean that I'm retarded)


# Triggers (topics you should avoid):
+ Self-harm (unless you're in a "life-death" situation, please do not talk about it with me directly)
+ 6th of January (don't ask)
+ Family Issues/Friction
+ Sexual Harrasment/Rape

# REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF:
+ When I feel uncomfortable on a convo, I will normally try to switch topics in the most indirect way (say, not saying anything for a while, doing sarcastic comments, etc)
+ I tend to be a bit manipulative (family genes suck)
+ Sometimes I might treat people harshly due to my mood swings; sorry about that beforehand.

# Extra Stuff:
+ I'm agnostic, so please keep religion pushing/forcing out of the table.
+ I AM NOLONGER PART OF THE SKYFOX TEAM.
+ As I've said before, I only speak Spanish, English and German. Please do not contact me in another language than those.
+ I play Piano... might be interesting to talk about it idk.
+ I'm a full fledged mexican citizen, I was born and raised **in** Mexico.
