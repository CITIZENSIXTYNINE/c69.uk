# [c69.uk](c69.uk)'s source code

[c69.uk](c69.uk) is my personal website. its more of a "business card" than a portafolio or whatever.

The site measures under 5kb by itself.

Site is hosted on [Github Pages](github.io) and uses [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) as its "CDN" for images and documents.

This site is so lightweight that it got rejected from the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club) for being [too lightweight](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/1mb-club/pull/773)!
