# <c69.uk>'s source code

<c69.uk> is my personal website. its more of a "business card" than a portafolio or whatever.

The site measures under 3kb (without the /ast/ folder) by itself.

This site is so lightweight that it got rejected from the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club) for being [too lightweight](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/1mb-club/pull/773)!
